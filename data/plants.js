The art of pickling and preserving cucumbers is centuries old. You can pickle or preserve any small cucumber, or eat picklers fresh right off the vine, so experiment with different varieties, regardless of how you intend to use them. In general, picklers are smallish, often warty, green, used for small sweet pickles or large dills, but the can also be eaten fresh. Slicers form 5- to 8-inch cylindrical cucumbers, used for slicing and serving fresh. Cucumbers grow best with long, hot, humid days with maximum sunshine and warm nights. Plants are extremely susceptible to frost.",

To seed in rows, plant seeds 1 inch deep and about 6 inches apart. To plant in hills, plant four or five seeds in 1-foot-diameter circles set 5 to 6 feet apart. Set up trellises for plants to climb on. Trellised cukes are straighter and have fewer insect and disease problems. ',

Keep your garlic plantings away from beans and peas as it could hinder their growth. Like onions, garlic is great for wide-row growing. Plant the cloves the full depth of the bulb , three or four inches apart, and firm the soil. Try a row 10 to 12 inches wide. To grow big garlic bulbs, plant the cloves in late fall. They'll mature the following summer. If you live in the North you can mulch garlic over the winter, but next season you'll have to watch out for seed stalks and pick them off right away. If you have a long growing season, you can also plant the cloves in the spring as soon as the ground can be worked. However, the resulting heads will be smaller than fall-planted garlic. If you live in the South or Southwest, plant the cloves anytime from the fall through early spring. Plant early because garlic isn't fond of hot weather.

Most gardeners plant "seed" potatoes, a confusing term since these aren\'t seeds at all but rather small potato tubers. For best results, purchase certified seed potatoes; these will have been inspected to ensure they are free from disease. Avoid planting supermarket potatoes, because they may have been treated with a growth inhibitor to prevent them from sprouting.
