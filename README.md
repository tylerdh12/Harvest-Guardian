## Description

The Project here was covered in Ben Awad's youtube video showing how to use React Native Navigation v5. That video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hln37dE19bs). I have decided to use this boilerplate code in future projects, so I added it here on github so I can modify the boilerplate as I develope more understanding of the TypeScript language and React Native. This is a good starting point to begin a project that requires routing. I will go back to the code to revise this project to guide users of this boilerplate where and what should be changed to build their own application. I would really like to thank Ben Awad for providing this video content to many to demonstrate the usage of React Native Navigation. Thank You!
